    "summary": "The world had witnessed several generations of the Internet. Starting with\nthe Fixed Internet, then the Mobile Internet, scientists now focus on many\ntypes of research related to the \"Thing\" Internet (or Internet of Things). The\nquestion is \"what is the next Internet generation after the Thing Internet?\"\nThis paper envisions about the Tactile Internet which could be the next\nInternet generation in the near future. The paper will introduce what is the\ntactile internet, why it could be the next future Internet, as well as the\nimpact and its application in the future society. Furthermore, some challenges\nand the requirements are presented to guide further research in this near\nfuture field.",

    "summary": "More and more scientific research shows that there is a close correlation\nbetween the Internet and brain science. This paper presents the idea of\nestablishing the Internet neurology, which means to make a cross-contrast\nbetween the two in terms of physiology and psychology, so that a complete\ninfrastructure system of the Internet is established, predicting the\ndevelopment trend of the Internet in the future as well as the brain structure\nand operation mechanism, and providing theoretical support for the generation\nprinciple of intelligence, cognition and emotion. It also proposes the\nviewpoint that the Internet can be divided into Internet neurophysiology,\nInternet neuropsychology, Brain Internet physiology, Brain Internet psychology\nand the Internet in cognitive science.",
