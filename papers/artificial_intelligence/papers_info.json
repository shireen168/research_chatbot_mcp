    "summary": "Who should be charged with responsibility for an artificial intelligence\nperforming market manipulation have been discussed. In this study, I\nconstructed an artificial intelligence using a genetic algorithm that learns in\nan artificial market simulation, and investigated whether the artificial\nintelligence discovers market manipulation through learning with an artificial\nmarket simulation despite a builder of artificial intelligence has no intention\nof market manipulation. As a result, the artificial intelligence discovered\nmarket manipulation as an optimal investment strategy. This result suggests\nnecessity of regulation, such as obligating builders of artificial intelligence\nto prevent artificial intelligence from performing market manipulation.",
